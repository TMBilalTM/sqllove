Download the following icon files from Leaflet's GitHub repository and place them in this folder:

1. marker-icon.png
2. marker-icon-2x.png
3. marker-shadow.png

These are from the Leaflet distribution and are needed for the default markers to display correctly.

You can find these files at:
https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/tree/main/dist/images
